  <p>Coronary Heart Disease (CHD), also known as Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), is a cardiovascular condition characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle. It's primarily caused by the buildup of plaque composed of cholesterol, fat, and other substances on the artery walls. This can restrict blood flow, leading to chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, and in severe cases, heart attacks. Risk factors for CHD include smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, diabetes, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle. Lifestyle modifications such as a healthy diet, regular exercise, smoking cessation, and medication management are crucial in preventing and managing CHD. Severe cases might require medical procedures like angioplasty to widen narrowed arteries or bypass surgery to redirect blood flow around blockages. CHD is a significant global health concern with implications for heart health and overall well-being.</p>
  <h5>Causes of CKD</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Diabetes</li>
    <li>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)</li>
    <li>Glomerulonephritis</li>
    <li>Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD)</li>
    <li>Autoimmune Diseases</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Symptoms and Signs</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Often asymptomatic, with kidney damage detected through tests.</li>
    <li>Blood and urine tests might show abnormal results.</li>
    <li>Fatigue and weakness due to anemia (low red blood cell count).</li>
    <li>Swelling (edema) in the legs and ankles.</li>
    <li>Increased need to urinate, especially at night.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Complications</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>CKD increases the risk of heart disease and stroke.</li>
    <li>Kidneys play a role in regulating blood pressure and maintaining fluid balance.</li>
    <li>Damaged kidneys produce less of the hormone erythropoietin, leading to anemia.</li>
    <li>Kidneys help regulate calcium and phosphorus levels.</li>
    <li>Imbalance can lead to weakened bones and increased risk of fractures.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Treatment</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Managing underlying conditions like diabetes and hypertension.</li>
    <li>Healthy diet, exercise, and weight management.</li>
    <li>Blood pressure medications (ACE inhibitors, ARBs) to protect the kidneys.</li>
    <li>Medications to control blood sugar levels in diabetes.</li>
    <li>End-stage CKD might require dialysis to filter waste and excess fluids from the blood.</li>
  </ul>
