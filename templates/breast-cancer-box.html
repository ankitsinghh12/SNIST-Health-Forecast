  <h1>Breast Cancer Information</h1>
</header>

  <p>Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the breast. It is a complex disease that can affect both men and women, but it is much more common in women. Breast cancer occurs when abnormal cells in the breast begin to grow uncontrollably and form a tumor. These tumors can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The most common type of breast cancer is invasive ductal carcinoma, which starts in the milk ducts and then invades nearby tissues. Other types include invasive lobular carcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and HER2-positive breast cancer. Risk factors for breast cancer include age, family history, certain gene mutations, hormonal factors, and exposure to estrogen. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment. Regular breast self-exams, clinical breast exams by healthcare professionals, and mammograms can help identify breast cancer in its early stages. Common symptoms include a lump in the breast or underarm, changes in breast size or shape, nipple discharge, and skin changes.</p>
  <h5>Symptoms</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Presence of a lump in the breast or underarm.</li>
    <li>Changes in breast size, shape, or appearance.</li>
    <li>Nipple discharge other than breast milk.</li>
    <li>Skin changes on the breast, like redness or dimpling.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Detection and Diagnosis</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Self-exams: Regular self-exams to notice any changes in breast tissue.</li>
    <li>Clinical exams: Healthcare professionals examine the breasts for any abnormalities.</li>
    <li>Mammograms: X-ray images of the breast that can detect tumors even before they're palpable.</li>
    <li>Biopsy: A sample of tissue is examined under a microscope to determine if it's cancerous.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Treatment</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Surgery: Removal of the tumor and, in some cases, the entire breast (mastectomy).</li>
    <li>Radiation therapy: High-energy rays to target and destroy cancer cells.</li>
    <li>Chemotherapy: Drugs to kill or slow the growth of cancer cells.</li>
    <li>Hormone therapy: Blocks hormones that fuel some types of breast cancer.</li>
  </ul>
  <h5>Prevention and Awareness</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise and a balanced diet.</li>
    <li>Regular screenings and check-ups for early detection.</li>
    <li>Increasing awareness through campaigns and education.</li>
  </ul>
